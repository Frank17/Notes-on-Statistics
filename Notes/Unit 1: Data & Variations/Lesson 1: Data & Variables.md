## Theory
**Population**: A collection of items that share certain similarities

**Sample**: A subset of the population

**Variables** are characteristics that describe people or objects in a population
- **Numerical** (or **quantitative**) **variables**: Variables that describe quantities (height, weight, scores, etc.)
- - **Discrete variables**: N.V. that are *countable* and can take on *distinct* values in an interval (year of birth, number of people, etc.)
- - **Continuous variables**: N.V. that are *uncountable* and can take on *any* values in an interval (exact weight/mass, etc.)
- **Categorical** (or **qualitative**) **variables**: Variables that describe qualities (gender, address, type of cars, etc.)

## Practice
- **1**: Continuous variable can take on an infinite number of values, but discrete variable can only take on a finite set of values. (T/F)
- **2**: You learned that a sample is a subset of population; Why, in your opinion, do we need to use sample in the first place?
- **3**: Give three more examples of discrete variables, continuous variables, and categorical variables each.
